# Ours: Chaoyang / DeiT-Ti

- Data: official mounted dataset under `/app/data/chaoyang`
- Teacher: fixed ResNet56 latest checkpoint, epoch 300, recorded Top-1 `81.53%`
- Student: DeiT-Ti from scratch
- Base protocol: 100 epochs, batch 64, AdamW `5e-4`, minimum LR `5e-6`,
  weight decay `0.05`, 5-epoch warm-up, cosine decay
- Input/recorded choices: 224 pixels, label smoothing `0.1`, seed `42`
- Loss: `CE + beta(e) * (0.5 * L_fuse + 0.5 * L_align)`
- Default beta reproduction: `beta_on=2.5`, then zero after the fully logged
  relative feature-distance plateau proxy
- Working-paper comparison target: `86.35%` Top-1

No supplied Chaoyang-specific Ours teacher-size config is available. The
source-compatible 32-pixel setting is therefore audited against this
repository's 224-trained teacher before any full run; a drop over 5 points
blocks training.

Timing run:

```bash
python methods/Ours/chaoyang/train.py --timing-run --num-workers 4
```

Full run only after the timing log and teacher audit pass:

```bash
python methods/Ours/chaoyang/train.py --student-epochs 100 --accept-alg-proxy --num-workers 4 --run-name ours_chaoyang_deit_ti_100ep --output-dir /app/output
```

Raw measured accuracy is retained; no teacher-gap correction is applied by
code. The 100-epoch dataset protocol is intentional. See
[`../PAPER_AUDIT.md`](../PAPER_AUDIT.md).
