# Ours: CIFAR-100 / DeiT-Ti

- Teacher: fixed ResNet56 best checkpoint, epoch 297, recorded Top-1 `68.68%`
- Student: DeiT-Ti from scratch
- Base protocol: 300 epochs, batch 128, AdamW `5e-4`, minimum LR `5e-6`,
  weight decay `0.05`, 20-epoch warm-up, cosine decay
- Input/recorded choices: 224 pixels, label smoothing `0.1`, seed `42`
- Ours: all 12 student blocks, ResNet stages 1/2/3, learned stage mixtures,
  `1x1` projection/QKV, `5x5` deformable attention, four heads
- Loss: `CE + beta(e) * (0.5 * L_fuse + 0.5 * L_align)`
- Default beta reproduction: `beta_on=2.5`, then zero after the fully logged
  relative feature-distance plateau proxy
- Working-paper comparison target: `82.42%` Top-1

The public DeiT-CIFAR source config uses a 32-pixel teacher input, so the code
evaluates the current 224-trained checkpoint at 32 before training. A drop over
5 percentage points blocks a full run and indicates that a compatible teacher
checkpoint/config is needed.

Timing run:

```bash
python methods/Ours/cifar100/train.py --timing-run --num-workers 4
```

Full run only after the timing log and teacher audit pass:

```bash
python methods/Ours/cifar100/train.py --student-epochs 300 --accept-alg-proxy --num-workers 4 --run-name ours_cifar100_deit_ti_300ep --output-dir /app/output
```

The adaptive proxy is a documented reproduction choice, not an exact official
ALG config. See [`../PAPER_AUDIT.md`](../PAPER_AUDIT.md).
