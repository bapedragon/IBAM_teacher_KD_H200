# Experiment status

Last updated: 2026-07-18

This document summarizes the completed H200 teacher and DeiT-Ti knowledge-distillation runs. Student scores use the best checkpoint Top-1 accuracy. A timing run is a two-epoch execution check and is not treated as a final result.

## 1. Selected teacher checkpoints

| Dataset | Teacher | Selected checkpoint | Epoch | Top-1 | Paper reference | Gap |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| CIFAR-100 | ResNet56 | Best | 297 | **68.68%** | 70.43% | -1.75pp |
| Flowers-102 | ResNet56 | Best | 291 | **64.64%** | 66.33% | -1.69pp |
| Chaoyang | ResNet56 | Latest | 300 | **81.53%** | 77.20% | +4.33pp |

For Chaoyang, the epoch-300 latest checkpoint was deliberately fixed for every KD method because it is closer to the paper reference than the 83.08% best checkpoint.

## 2. Main DeiT-Ti comparison

Values in parentheses are gains over the corresponding Vanilla DeiT-Ti result.

| Method | CIFAR-100 | Flowers-102 | Chaoyang |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Vanilla | 65.08% | 50.06% | 82.00% |
| KD | 67.00% (+1.92pp) | 45.88% (-4.18pp) | 80.60% (-1.40pp) |
| CRD | 67.40% (+2.32pp) | 46.63% (-3.43pp) | 76.48% (-5.52pp) |
| ReviewKD | 72.84% (+7.76pp) | 50.76% (+0.70pp) | 81.53% (-0.47pp) |
| **MGD** | **73.71% (+8.63pp)** | **51.57% (+1.51pp)** | **81.81% (-0.19pp)** |
| OFA | 66.18% (+1.10pp) | Not started | Not started |

## 4. Current progress

| Method | CIFAR-100 | Flowers-102 | Chaoyang |
|---|---|---|---|
| KD | Full run complete | Full run complete | Full run complete |
| CRD | Full run complete | Full run complete | Full run complete |
| ReviewKD | Full run complete | Full run complete | Full run complete |
| MGD | Full run complete | Full run complete | Full run complete |
| OFA | Full run complete | Not started | Not started |

The CIFAR-100 OFA full run completed in 4 h 00 min 32 s. Its best checkpoint reached 66.18% at epoch 227; the epoch-300 latest checkpoint reached 65.92%.

## 5. Exploratory runs outside Table 2

| Method | Dataset | Student | Epochs | Best Top-1 | Vanilla | Gain |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| KD | CIFAR-100 | ConViT-Tiny | 300 | **73.59%** | 74.87% | -1.28pp |
| KD | CIFAR-100 | PiT-Tiny | 300 | **72.22%** | 73.16% | -0.94pp |

## 6. Current interpretation

- MGD is currently the strongest completed generic KD method on all three datasets.
- On CIFAR-100, MGD improves over Vanilla by 8.63 percentage points; on Flowers-102, it improves by 1.51 points.
- On Chaoyang, the selected teacher accuracy (81.53%) is slightly below Vanilla DeiT-Ti (82.00%), so improving the student through KD is intrinsically difficult. MGD is currently closest to Vanilla at -0.19 points.
- All reported values above are raw measured best-checkpoint accuracies. No teacher-gap proportional correction has been applied.
